# 04-Quiz-Game

This is a quiz based game that uses javascript functionality.

There are aspects of this game that are unfinished because I am not very good at javascript yet. Such as, there is no high scores page or timer function.

For the logic, I watched many different tutorials on youtube and picked and pulled different pieces of code from examples and molded them to what I needed.  There are some aspects that I still don't fully 100% understand, but I know that it works to a point.

The theme of my quiz is about the Inifity Stones from the Marvel Comic Universe. I hope you're ready to nerd out!
